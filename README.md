# Bouncing-Ball-GAME
This is a 2D game made using C++ and SDL.
To be able to play this game, you need to link the SDL include and library files i have included with this package. 
They need to be linked with the linker for your compiler
Only then can the programcompile and run
I am working on bundling everything in an executable file but until then, this is the solution
